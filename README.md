AI-Driven Portfolio Management System

Welcome to the AI-Driven Portfolio Management System — a smart, automated tool that helps make better investment decisions using machine learning and reinforcement learning. Whether you're backtesting, experimenting, or deploying live strategies, this system provides a flexible foundation to build from.

 What It Does-

This project uses AI agents (like DQN or PPO) to dynamically manage an investment portfolio. It learns from historical price patterns, market indicators, and simulated trading environments to make informed asset allocation decisions.

Think of it as building a robot fund manager that learns from past data and continuously improves with experience.
